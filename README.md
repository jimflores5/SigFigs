### Overview
 - In high school Chemistry, there are several basic (yet critical) skills that students must master.  These include taking quality measurements, performing metric conversions, dealing with significant figures/scientific notation, solving problems using dimensional analysis and writing chemical formulas.
 - Each of these skills gets better with practice, but how much practice a student needs varies from person to person.  Providing each student with just the right amount of practice AND timely feedback is challenging.
 - This project deals with the concepts of significant figures and scientific notation.  It combines interactive tutorials (useful for a flipped classroom or independent study) with an “infinite practice” mode that provides immediate feedback to user input.  This pairing helps students learn the new skills faster, which allows teachers to dedicate more class time to advanced topics.
 
### Features
 - Interactive tutorials (dynaminc notes, short video clips and guided practice problems) help introduce students to the new skills.
 - "Infinite practice" options provide immediate feedback to help students master the new skills.
