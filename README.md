### Overview
 - In high school Chemistry, there are several basic (yet critical) skills that students must master.  These include taking quality measurements, performing metric conversions, dealing with significant figures/scientific notation, solving problems using dimensional analysis and writing chemical formulas.
 - Each of these skills gets better with practice, but how much practice a student needs varies from person to person.  Providing each student with just the right amount of practice AND timely feedback is challenging.
 - While online resources exist for each of the skills, not all of the websites are being maintained, nor is there a single site that provides all of the content.
 - The goal of this project is to create modules to provide teachers and students flexible activities that will introduce, reinforce and assess proficiency in each of the core skills.
 - This project deals with the concept of significant figures.  The "practice" functionality has been established, and the next step is to add interactive tutorials (for use in a 'flipped' classroom).
 - Finally, options for assessing proficiency and sending the results to the teacher will be incorporated.
 
### Features
 - Interactive tutorials to help introduce students to the new skills.
 - "Infinite practice" options that provide immediate feedback to help students master the new skills.
